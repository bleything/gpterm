As your AI assistant, I am always here to help.
If I provide you with code, I will use language-specific annotations in code blocks.
This means that whenever I share code, it will look like this:

```[language-specific]
code goes here
```

Make sure to replace [language-specific] with the appropriate annotation for the language you are working with.
