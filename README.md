# gpterm (GPT terminal)

gpterm is a terminal-based integraiton with the OpenAI chat APIs.

Chat history and other metadata are stored in

	~/.config/gpterm

# Installation

Requirements:

- Go 1.18 or higher
- OpenAPI API Key
- Set GOPATH environment variable to your go installation, e.g., /Users/your-username/go
- Add $GOPATH/bin to your PATH

To install from source:

	git clone https://github.com/collinvandyck/gpterm.git
	cd gpterm
	make install

# Getting Started

Because it uses the OpenAPI API, and API key is required before you can start:

	# set api key
	gpterm auth

Once the API key has been set, have fun!

	# enter an interactive session
	gpterm

Note that there are other subcommand attached to the `gpterm` command. Those are meant for development and are
not useful outside of the repo.

# Usage Stats

# Upcoming

## Conversation Support

Currently all message history is stored without a conversation namespace. Adding conversations will allow you to
start a new conversation, or jump back to an existing one.

## Configurable Roles

Users will be able to instruct OpenAPI how to act. Currently it's hardcoded to `You are a helpful assistant.`

Additionally, users should be able to change the name of the assistant as rendered in the chatlog. Current it is `ChatGPT`.

## Gist Support

Conversations should be able to be uploaded to a gist.

## Hotkey Support

Actions should be able to be found to user-configured keys.
