# gpterm

gpterm is a terminal-based integraiton with the OpenAI chat APIs.

It's very much a work in progress and is under active development.

# installation

## from source

	git clone https://github.com/collinvandyck/gpterm.git
	cd gpterm

I've got a lot of things coming up, not limited to:

- conversation persistence (no chat context is currently sent to the API)
- markdown viewer
- fzf integration
